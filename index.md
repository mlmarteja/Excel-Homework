## How to Create PivotTables in Excel

In this tutorial, I will illustrate how to utilize a PivotTable tool in Excel. PivotTables is a generic terms that is coined by Microsoft. According to Microsoft, [PivotTable](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-pivottable-to-analyze-worksheet-data-a9a84538-bfe9-40a9-a8e9-f99134456576) is a powerful tool that is used to calculate, summarize and analyze data. In addtion, it allows the user to see data comparisons, patterns, and trends.


## Step 1 - Open Microsoft Excel
Download [Microsoft Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel). You could either buy it or try it for free. When Excel is downloaded, make sure **Sign In** or **Sign Up** with your Microsoft Account. 


## Step 2 - Create a SpreadSheet or Add an Existing Data Set
Once the Excel has been launched, start a new spreadsheet. To start a new spread sheet, select **Blank workbook** and start adding data.

An alternative is to just open an existing data set by selecting **File**. For this tutorial, I used [Plant Height Data](https://github.com/mlmarteja/Excel-Homework/blob/91b422a0b3023786847a292e1e368ff3746410d2/Plant%20Height%20Data%20-%20Data.csv) that was provided by Arielle from the previous Data Science Class

## Step 3 - Insert -> PivotTable
To get to the PivotTable, go to Insert and under that menu, the option to create a PivotTable should be available.

Once PivotTable is selected, a window will pop up and display a menu that will ask the user for the range of data that will be used in the PivotTable.
